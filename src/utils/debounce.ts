/**
 * Returns a debounced function.
 *
 * Has all the typical options (e.g. trailing, leading) for a debounce function, but it can also create debounced queues.
 *
 * # Debounced Queues
 *
 * ## What are they?
 *
 * Queues allow you to avoid creating a debounce function for every instance that needs to debounce the same function.
 *
 * For example, say you want to debounce the saving of notes to a database until after a user stops typing. For each note open you would have to create a debounced version of the save function, and usually, when using frameworks, this would happen at the component level, not the store because the store save function is shared.
 *
 * Queues would allow you to avoid all that, and keep all the saving logic at the store level, allowing components to just call save normally.
 *
 * ## Options
 *
 * ### Queues
 *
 * To use queues, either pass `{ queues: true }` or `{ queues: {} }`. You can also have multiple debounced functions share a queue (e.g. save and delete):
 *
 * ```ts
 * const sharedQueue = {}
 * const save = debounce(_save, 1000, {
 * 	queues: sharedQueue
 * })
 * const remove = debounce(_remove, 1000, {
 * 	queues: sharedQueue
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Index
 *
 * Internally the queues object looks like this, where `key` is one of the arguments passed to the function (e.g. a note's id), by default the first, and it deletes the key after a function is finally called:
 *
 * ```ts
 * queues: {
 * 	[key]: {
 * 		// ... info needed internally
 * 	}
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * So the following would debounce the callback based on the id the function was called with:
 *
 * ```ts
 * function _save(id, some, other, arguments) {
 * 	//...
 * }
 * const save = debounce(_save, 1000)
 * // equivalent of debounce(_save, 1000, {index: 0})
 * ```
 *
 * If you need to debounce based on something more complicated (a property of an argument or multiple arguments) index can be a function that returns the key to use.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const save = debounce(_save, 1000, {
 * 	index: (arguments) => {
 * 		// multiple arguments
 * 		return arguments[0] + arguments[2]
 * 		// some key of the arguments
 * 		return arguments[0].someProperty
 * 	}
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @param callback The function to debounce.
 *
 * @param wait How long to wait before calling the function after the last call. Defaults to 0

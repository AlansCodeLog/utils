 * This is not meant to work with arrays, but it does, returning `number[]` instead.

 * See {@link Keys} @see Keys [[Keys]] for more details (note the order of the type parameters are inverted for this function for convenience, e.g., you'll rarely need to pass the type of the object, it's more likely you'll want to narrow the keys).

/**
 * Inserts a string into another at the given range or position.
 *
 * It will throw an `ErrorW<{range: [number, number]}>` if the (normalized*) range's start comes after the end.
 *
 * \* Negative ranges are normalized to positive positions. If the range is still negative after the normalization this means it was out of bounds (e.g. before the string's start) and it's set to zero. So passing a range like `[-20, -10]` with a string of length 1, would *not* error, since it's just interpreted as `[0, 0]` (which is how slice already works).
